# Helm Product Overview

## Core Metaphor
Helm stages thought as a living archipelago of inquiries. Text nodes become islands connected by agent-forged bridges, while the ReactFlow graph and Monaco editor render every branch as a navigable coastline. The user stands at the helm of a ship charting this terrain, steering scouts, witnesses, and copilots that each embody a navigational instinct—expansion, critique, or consolidation. This maritime forest mingles depth-first dives with panoramic cartography, so ideas feel both rooted and adrift as agents roam and report back.

## User Journey
1. **Initialization** – The onboarding overlay points power users to the Settings pane where they supply an OpenRouter key, tune branch depth, and choose fonts or palettes that set the mood for exploration.
2. **Agent Configuration** – In the left module, Scout, Witness, and Campaign cards invite custom instructions and branching factors. Keyboard invoke mode (Cmd/Ctrl+X) binds each agent to hotkeys for quick dispatches.
3. **Launching Exploration** – Selecting a node focuses the Monaco editor on that branch while the graph recenters. Starting a Scout locks the node, spawns autonomous continuations through OpenRouter, and sprouts children inline.
4. **Tree Navigation** – As branches multiply, the right panel offers reduction controls: merge chains, cull to bookmarks, or trigger Witness passes that prune weak limbs while preserving bookmarked artifacts.
5. **Synthesis** – Copilot sweeps freshly grown paths, suggesting culls or expansions, and the user merges promising leaves into coherent prose. Exporting or saving snapshots closes the loop, delivering a distilled map of the excursion.

## Agency Feel
Helm’s agents behave like specialized shipmates. Scouts are bold cartographers, fanning outward with confidence; Witnesses act as editors, skeptical yet fair; Campaign orchestrates alternating tides of divergence and convergence. Copilot feels like a vigilant first mate who respects the captain’s focus by refusing to delete the active branch. Autonomy is palpable yet deferential—the system locks nodes during runs, streams rationales into agent cards, and always yields to manual overrides.

## Cognitive Texture
Momentum swings between curiosity and curation. When multiple scouts run, the graph swells into a shimmering delta that can overwhelm, but bookmarks and reduction commands restore legibility. Tree reduction compresses linear paths, reinforcing a sense of sculpting insight rather than drowning in drafts. Users oscillate between flow states—typing in Monaco while agents harvest ideas—and reflective pauses when Witness or Copilot summarize. The interplay keeps attention agile: you watch the graph bloom, then pivot to edit, prune, or merge, feeling alternately expansive and incisive.

## Comparative Insight
Helm inherits Loom’s dialogic tree but amplifies autonomy through configurable ranges and campaign cycles. Compared with Aide’s clustering, Helm emphasizes agent choreography over passive maps. Muse 2’s spatial canvas encourages freeform arrangement, whereas Helm insists on hierarchical accountability and reduction rituals. Logseq-AI shares graph DNA but centers on memory and query; Helm targets live reasoning. Kinopio’s playful canvases favor serendipity without critique, while Helm pairs exploration with disciplined Witness audits. Helm thus occupies a niche for researchers who crave both wild branching and rigorous consolidation within one reflective cockpit.

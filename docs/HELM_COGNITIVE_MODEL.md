# Helm Cognitive Model

## Augmented Thinking Modes
Helm augments both divergent and convergent cognition. Scouts catalyze breadth by fanning out hypotheses at configurable depths and ranges, while Witness and tree reduction tools compress, evaluate, and merge. Copilot mediates between the two extremes, offering situational nudges that keep the user from over-pruning or over-growing. The system therefore promotes cyclical thinking: expansion → critique → synthesis.

## Externalized Memory and Structure
Every node in the tree captures a slice of thought, synchronized between Monaco’s linear text and the ReactFlow graph’s topology. Bookmarks act as memory anchors, designating waypoints that future reduction passes must respect. Persisted settings and trees convert the workspace into a longitudinal archive, letting the user revisit prior campaigns as structured journals rather than freeform documents.

## Feedback Dynamics
1. **User → Agents**: The user seeds intent through instructions, range, and depth parameters, as well as manual bookmarks that signal sanctuaries.
2. **Agents → Graph/Text**: Scouts and copilots mutate the tree by adding, pruning, or merging nodes, immediately reflecting their decisions in both the editor and visualization.
3. **Graph/Text → User**: The swelling or slimming of branches provides affective feedback—dense clusters demand pruning, sparse lines invite exploration.
4. **Witness Loop**: Witness uses OpenRouter judgments to reshape the topology, surfacing a critique that the user can audit via logs.

## Tree Reduction as Sense-Making
Reduction operates as editorial compression. Mass Merge collapses redundant single-child chains, transforming exploratory chatter into concise summaries. Cull & Merge to Bookmarks draws hard boundaries around cherished insights, distilling complex forests into curated groves. These actions embody sense-making rituals: they tame noise, preserve signal, and align the workspace with narrative clarity.

## Authorship Perception
Helm blurs authorship by interleaving human prose with agent-generated continuations. Because agents lock nodes and leave transcript trails, users experience them as accountable collaborators rather than invisible ghosts. Yet the ease of campaign cycles can tilt ownership toward the system; vigilance in reviewing Witness deletions and Copilot culls keeps the human editor in command. Authorship becomes a duet: the user orchestrates direction and final synthesis, while agents supply raw material and critique.

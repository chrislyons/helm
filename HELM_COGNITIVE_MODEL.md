# Helm as Cognitive Prosthesis

## Augmented Thinking Modes
Helm amplifies **divergent ideation** by letting users schedule Scouts that fan out new continuations in parallel while the manual editor remains available for reflective note-taking. **Convergent synthesis** is supported through Witness pruning, Copilot culling, and mass-merge utilities that collapse chains and enforce focus. The graph module fosters **structural reasoning**, enabling users to see argument topology and identify clusters needing attention.

## Locus of Authorship
Autonomous exploration shifts authorship toward a **curatorial stance**. Users seed prompts, set guardrails (instructions, depth, range), and designate bookmarks as sacred anchors; agents generate prose, but the user legitimizes outcomes by accepting, merging, or pruning branches. Helm frames agency as orchestration: humans specify direction and constraints, machines execute branching searches.

## Memory Compression & Narrative Shaping
Tree-management tools act as **memory compression**. Mass merge preserves narrative continuity while eliminating redundant nodes. Cull-to-bookmarks distills a sprawling exploration down to key waypoints, functioning like an executive summary of the thought tree. Copilot outputs provide localized commentary that acts as **narrative shaping**, contextualizing why nodes were kept or discarded.

## Psychological Tradeoffs
- **Benefits**: Rapid exploration reduces blank-page anxiety, parallel agents surface surprising associations, and visualization aids situational awareness.
- **Costs**: Autonomy can outpace comprehension; without disciplined bookmarking the graph becomes overwhelming. Delegating culling to Witness or Copilot risks losing nuance, and the absence of undo heightens the perceived risk of automation.
- **Mitigations**: Locks respect user focus, bookmarks protect treasured ideas, and stop buttons or hotkeys reassert control when agents feel overzealous.

## Ideal Personas
- **Researchers & strategists** who manage hypothesis trees and need to compare divergent lines of inquiry.
- **Writers & essayists** seeking structured brainstorming with iterative refinement.
- **Systems thinkers & facilitators** comfortable orchestrating multi-agent processes and interpreting graph topologies.
- **Design philosophers** exploring meta-dialogue, as Helm surfaces the conversation between generative and critical voices.
